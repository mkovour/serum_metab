The purpose of this - get an idea of the serum metabolite data! (This dataset was serum metbaolites collected longitudinally for 62 Monkeys to look at key biomarkers of aging) HOW:

Clean dataset (get rid of NAs, no weird values in excel sheets, get rid of duplciates)
Normalize/Check Distribution + Adjust accoridngly
Visualize the Data as best fit
RF Modeling/ VIP Modeling to narrow down key metabolites
Spearman Correlation and Network analysis to further understand the interaction of these biomarkers
